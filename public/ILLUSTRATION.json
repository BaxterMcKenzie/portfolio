        "description": "For this project, I collaborated with a friend to create a cohesive visual identity for their 30th birthday celebration. The theme was a lively cowboy-inspired hoedown with a playful focus on fried chicken.I designed a poster and banner that captured the rustic charm of the Wild West, blending bold typography, earthy tones, and illustrative elements like cowboy hats, boots, and fried chicken motifs. These designs set the tone for the event, adding personality and excitement. As a last-minute addition, I also created a custom photo album cover to commemorate the celebration. The cover mirrored the event's theme, tying all elements together into a cohesive and memorable design package.This project highlights my ability to adapt quickly to evolving requirements while delivering designs that resonate with the intended audience and theme.",
