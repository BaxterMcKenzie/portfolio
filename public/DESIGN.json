    "description": "The Daily Beer Can project was a collaborative effort between myself and two friends, where we designed a unique beer can each day. Each design featured a brand name, logo, beer name, and background, drawing inspiration from iconic pop culture movies. This project was both a creative challenge and a learning experience. Collaborating in Figma, we worked to daily deadlines, played to our strengths, and explored new design techniques. The process taught us valuable lessons about teamwork, adaptability, and pushing creative boundaries. Below are some of my favorite designs from this fun and rewarding project.",
