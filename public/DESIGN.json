    "description": "Client Flyer: Kinetic Recruitment sought to create a vibrant flyer for their employees to distribute to clients. They aimed for a design that was engaging and energetic, departing from conventional, dull flyers. After exploring several concepts, we collectively decided on two standout designs that struck the perfect balance between eye-catching visuals and a corporate aesthetic.<br><br>Client Testimonial: At Kinetic, the emphasis is on fostering a friendly, hardworking team dedicated to helping people find employment. They requested a playful yet easily readable design that would align with their existing brand colors. To facilitate sharing on social media, we designed a square template that allows for easy updates. We created multiple template variations to ensure a fresh and dynamic presentation without becoming repetitive.<br><br>Ink Ribbon Breakfast: In support of Pink Ribbon Month, Kinetic Recruitment organized a delightful event where they distributed boxes of cupcakes to clients. They envisioned a design that was not only fun and vibrant, reflecting the pink theme, but also communicated a powerful message about the impact of breast cancer on countless individuals in New Zealand. The design effectively captured the essence of this important cause while maintaining an inviting and cheerful atmosphere.",

        "description": "This project showcases a detailed Pokémon viewer, built with React, where users can explore individual Pokémon stats, abilities, and moves in a visually engaging way. The interface features dynamic data rendering using React Router for seamless navigation and Axios for fetching Pokémon data. Each Pokémon card displays both official artwork and animated sprites, with relevant stats such as HP, attack, and speed. Custom CSS styling enhances the user experience, with type-based color schemes that adjust dynamically to match the primary Pokémon type. A playful touch is added with GSAP-powered Pokéball animations, creating a fun and interactive feel. Sound integration allows users to listen to both modern and legacy Pokémon cries, enriching the immersion. The layout adapts responsively to different screen sizes using CSS modules, ensuring a smooth experience across devices. This project reflects my skills in front-end development, interactive design, and working with APIs to build dynamic, data-driven applications.",
